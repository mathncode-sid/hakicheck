**“Truth in Every Click”**

HakiCheck is an AI-powered platform designed to verify the authenticity of news articles and headlines in real time. Built for digital citizens navigating the age of misinformation, it flags potentially fake content, provides confidence scores, and offers links to verified sources — all in a matter of seconds.

## 🌐 Overview

Misinformation is a growing crisis, spreading faster than truth and threatening public trust, political stability, and health outcomes. Traditional fact-checking is often slow, manual, and inaccessible to everyday users.

HakiCheck aims to solve this with a real-time, AI-driven web application built using:
- **Python + Django** (Backend)
- **PostgreSQL** (Database)
- **Machine Learning** (Fake news classification)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)

## 💡 Key Features (Planned)
- Submit a news headline or article for analysis
- Receive a verifiability score: `Real`, `Fake`, or `Uncertain`
- See a confidence percentage
- View AI-generated reasoning
- Explore similar fact-checked sources

## 🧭 Project Status

**In Progress**  
We are currently at the planning and initial setup phase. Development is structured into weekly milestones, starting with database setup, UI design, and ML model training.

## 🔍 Vision

To empower digital users with immediate, transparent, and explainable news verification, especially in misinformation-prone regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa.
